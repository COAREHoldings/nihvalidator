**SPECIFIC AIMS****:** High-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) initially responds to platinum-based chemotherapy; yet nearly 80% of patients relapse within three years. Doublecortin-like kinase 1 (DCLK1), a cancer stem cell (CSC) marker minimally expressed in normal adult tissues, drives platinum resistance and metastasis in HGSOC. Thus, targeting DCLK1 offers an opportunity to eradicate CSCs, overcome resistance, and improve outcomes in recurrent disease, addressing an urgent, unmet clinical need.

Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy has transformed the treatment of hematologic malignancies but has shown limited success in solid tumors due to the scarcity of tumor-specific antigens, the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, and insufficient T-cell persistence. CBT-611H is a novel CAR-T therapy directed against the extracellular domains of DCLK1 isoforms 2 and 4, offering a first-in-class approach to eliminate DCLK1⁺ chemo-resistant CSCs. Combining CBT-611H with carboplatin is an innovative strategy to overcome platinum resistance by eliminating the stem-like cells that sustain the disease.

This Fast-Track STTR integrates Phase I mechanistic and human-relevant proof-of-concept studies with Phase II IND-enabling development to advance CBT-611H toward first-in-human trials. Quantitative assessment of DCLK1 surface expression (via flow cytometry, IHC, and related assays) will be used solely to confirm antigen specificity and distinguish on-target tumor activity from potential off-tumor effects; DCLK1 will not be used as a clinical biomarker or companion diagnostic in this application. The overall objective of this STTR is to develop and clinically enable a DCLK1-targeted CAR-T therapy (CBT-611H) in combination with carboplatin, with the ultimate long-term goal of curative cellular therapies for platinum-resistant HGSOC. Our central hypothesis is that CBT-611H will selectively eradicate DCLK1⁺ CSCs and that carboplatin will further enhance antitumor efficacy and durability without unacceptable off-tumor toxicity.

**Phase I (Year 1): Aim 1. Quantify real-time cytotoxicity and immune activation induced by CBT-611H + carboplatin in platinum-resistant HGSOC spheroids/organoids.** Using cisplatin-resistant HGSOC spheroids/organoids with defined DCLK1 surface expression, we will measure tumor cell killing, cytokine release, and T-cell activation/exhaustion to characterize combinatorial antitumor activity.

**Aim 2. Define the therapeutic efficacy and CAR-T specificity of CBT-611H ± carboplatin in patient-derived ovarian cancer organoids (PDOs).** PDOs generated from platinum-resistant HGSOC ascites will be treated with CBT-611H, carboplatin, the combination, or vehicle. We will assess viability, depletion of CSC-associated populations (DCLK1⁺, ALDH1A1⁺, CD133⁺), cytokine production, and T-cell activation, and correlate these findings with DCLK1 cell-surface expression to confirm CAR-T specificity and CSC targeting.

**Aim 3. Assess multiplex safety of CBT-611H ± carboplatin using human microphysiologic (organ-on-a-chip) platforms.** We will evaluate toxicity across key off-tumor tissues and quantify DCLK1 surface expression in normal compartments to distinguish on-target tumor killing (Aims 1–2) from potential off-tumor engagement, thereby de-risking first-in-human translation.

Phase II (Years 2–3): **Aim 4. Develop and qualify a scalable pre-GMP manufacturing process and analytical release panel for CBT-611H for use in animal studies and future GMP translation**. We will establish scalable, closed-system lentiviral and CAR-T manufacturing workflows for T-cell activation and transduction, expansion, and cryopreservation. Pre-GMP engineering runs will define critical process parameters and quality attributes, with release testing for identity, purity, sterility, vector copy number, and potency (cytotoxicity in DCLK1⁺ vs. DCLK1⁻ cells).

**Aim 5. Conduct ****pre-IND****-enabling pharmacology, efficacy, biodistribution, and safety studies of CBT-611H ± carboplatin in humanized NSG models.** We will evaluate antitumor efficacy in orthotopic or intraperitoneal models of platinum-resistant HGSOC; perform pre-GLP toxicology with expanded neurologic, hematologic, and organ-specific assessments; characterize biodistribution and persistence of CBT-611H and lentiviral vector; and monitor cytokine release syndrome (CRS) with predefined intervention criteria. DCLK1 expression in tumor versus normal tissues will support a mechanistic interpretation of on-target versus off-tumor effects. These studies will define the therapeutic index and no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) to support the IND submission.

Impact. Completion of these aims will deliver a first-in-class DCLK1-targeted CAR-T therapy with a de-risked manufacturing and safety package and a clear IND path for platinum-resistant HGSOC. This work will establish a generalizable strategy for safely targeting CSC-associated antigens in solid tumors and could significantly improve outcomes for patients with limited options.

**Research Strategy Plan**** (Phase 1)**

**A. Significance** High-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) is the most common and aggressive histologic subtype of epithelial ovarian cancer and accounts for ~70% of ovarian cancer–related deaths. In the U.S., >19,000 new ovarian cancer cases and ~12,740 deaths were estimated for 2024, with HGSOC responsible for most of the mortality. Nearly 75% of patients present with advanced-stage disease with peritoneal metastases, and although initial responses to platinum-based chemotherapy exceed 70%, ~80% relapse within three years and ultimately die of platinum-resistant disease.

Platinum resistance, which often emerges within six months of frontline therapy, is the strongest predictor of poor prognosis and is associated with a median progression-free survival of 3–4 months and median overall survival of ~12 months. Current options for recurrent platinum-resistant HGSOC—sequential cytotoxics, PARP inhibitors, and anti-angiogenic agents—offer modest, short-lived benefit with cumulative toxicities (myelosuppression, neuropathy, renal and GI toxicity) and no durable disease control. There is a critical unmet clinical need for therapies that overcome platinum resistance, reduce treatment-related toxicity, and extend survival in platinum-resistant HGSOC.

Doublecortin-like kinase 1 (DCLK1) has emerged as a compelling therapeutic target in multiple epithelial malignancies. Initially identified as a tuft-cell marker, DCLK1 is now recognized as a cancer stem-cell (CSC) marker associated with chemoresistance, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), tumor immune evasion, and poor prognosis. In HGSOC, DCLK1 is enriched in platinum-resistant disease, where it marks CSC-like populations that drive recurrence and metastatic dissemination. Elevated DCLK1 expression correlates with poor overall survival and is tightly associated with EMT and an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Importantly, DCLK1 isoforms 2 and 4 are expressed on the cell surface of CSC-like cells, while expression in normal adult tissues is limited, suggesting a favorable therapeutic index.

CAR-T therapy has transformed the treatment of hematologic malignancies but has shown limited success in solid tumors due to: (i) scarcity of truly tumor-specific antigens; (ii) poor T-cell trafficking and infiltration; and (iii) profound immunosuppression within the TME. No FDA-approved CAR-T therapies exist for solid tumors, and no late-stage programs specifically target CSC-associated antigens such as DCLK1. CBT-611H is a novel CAR-T therapy directed against the extracellular domains of DCLK1 isoforms 2 and 4, designed to selectively eliminate DCLK1⁺ chemo-resistant CSCs. Combining CBT-611H with carboplatin is a rational strategy to overcome platinum resistance by: (1) eradicating the stem-like reservoir that sustains relapse while (2) leveraging carboplatin’s ability to debulk bulk tumor and modulate the microenvironment.

Preliminary data from our group and others demonstrate that: • DCLK1 is elevated in HGSOC and correlates with poor prognosis, reduced disease-free and overall survival, particularly in platinum-treated patients. • DCLK1 induces drug resistance, drives EMT, promotes metastasis, and contributes to an immunosuppressive TME. Genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of DCLK1 re-sensitizes resistant spheroids to cisplatin and suppresses metastatic phenotypes. • First-generation DCLK1 CAR-T cells targeting the identical extracellular domain show robust cytotoxicity and inhibit xenograft growth in colorectal cancer models. • Second-generation CBT-611H CAR-T cells targeting the C-terminal extracellular domain on HGSOC cells demonstrate dose-dependent real-time cytotoxicity, significant efficacy vs. mock CAR-T (p < 0.0001), and specificity for DCLK1, with no killing in DCLK1-knockout cells.

Collectively, these findings support DCLK1 as a CSC-linked platinum-resistance driver and establish CBT-611H as a promising first-in-class DCLK1-targeted CAR-T therapy for platinum-resistant HGSOC.

This Fast-Track STTR is significant because it: 1. Directly targets the CSC reservoir that drives platinum resistance and relapse in HGSOC, rather than only bulk tumor cells. 2. Integrates Phase I mechanistic, human-relevant proof-of-concept studies—using cisplatin-resistant spheroids, patient-derived organoids (PDOs), and microphysiologic safety platforms—with Phase II IND-enabling development (manufacturing, pharmacology, biodistribution, and safety in humanized NSG models). 3. Focuses on DCLK1 as a mechanistic and specificity marker, where quantitative assessment of DCLK1 surface expression (by flow cytometry, IHC, and related assays) is used solely to confirm antigen specificity and to distinguish on-target tumor activity from potential off-tumor effects; DCLK1 will not be used as a clinical biomarker or companion diagnostic in this application. 4. Will, upon successful completion, deliver a de-risked, first-in-class DCLK1-targeted CAR-T therapy (CBT-611H) combined with carboplatin, with a clear IND path for platinum-resistant HGSOC and a generalizable framework for safely targeting CSC-associated antigens in solid tumors.

**B. Innovation** This project is innovative at multiple levels:

CSC-targeted CAR-T therapy for HGSOC. Targeting DCLK1⁺ CSCs—the cellular reservoir that drives platinum resistance, metastatic recurrence, and treatment failure—is the central innovation. No CAR-T therapy in clinical use or late-stage development has demonstrated specific potency against DCLK1⁺ CSCs.

Rational chemotherapy + CAR-T combination. Pre-treatment with carboplatin is designed to debulk tumor, remodel the TME, and potentially enhance CAR-T infiltration, while CBT-611H eliminates the residual DCLK1⁺ CSCs that fuel relapse. This strategy directly counteracts chemotherapy-induced enrichment of stem-like tumor cells and reframes platinum therapy as a priming agent rather than a stand-alone cytotoxic.

Integration of human microphysiologic (organ-on-a-chip) safety platforms. Aim 3 introduces multiplex safety assessment of CBT-611H ± carboplatin across human microphysiologic organ-on-a-chip models (e.g., liver, kidney, heart, lung, brain, and GI). These platforms allow simultaneous evaluation of off-tumor toxicities, cytokine responses, and effects on human tissue function at clinically relevant exposures. This is a novel, human-relevant safety screen positioned before in vivo IND-enabling studies.

Mechanistic, not clinical, use of DCLK1 quantification. Rather than proposing a clinical biomarker or companion diagnostic in this application, we use quantitative DCLK1 surface expression strictly to: (i) confirm antigen specificity; (ii) distinguish on-target tumor killing from off-tumor engagement; and (iii) mechanistically interpret efficacy and safety readouts. This is an important conceptual shift that addresses prior concerns about biomarker scope while still leveraging DCLK1 biology to de-risk translation.

Comprehensive IND-enabling framework for solid-tumor CAR-T. The Phase II program integrates pre-GMP manufacturing, orthotopic/intraperitoneal efficacy models, GLP-like pharmacology/toxicology in humanized NSG mice, and detailed biodistribution and CRS monitoring. Together, these elements create a blueprint for first-in-class CSC-targeted CAR-T programs in other DCLK1-driven malignancies.

**C. Approach** Overall Strategy and Preliminary Studies Our central hypothesis is that CBT-611H will selectively eradicate DCLK1⁺ CSCs and that carboplatin will further enhance antitumor efficacy and durability without unacceptable off-tumor toxicity. Phase I focuses on mechanistic efficacy and human-relevant safety (Aims 1–3). Phase II focuses on pre-GMP manufacturing and IND-enabling pharmacology, biodistribution, and safety in humanized NSG models (Aims 4–5).

Preliminary data (summarized in Significance) demonstrate that: DCLK1 is elevated and functionally important in HGSOC and platinum resistance. DCLK1 inhibition reduces metastatic phenotypes and re-sensitizes tumors to platinum. First- and second-generation DCLK1 CAR-T cells, including CBT-611H, exhibit DCLK1-dependent cytotoxicity against HGSOC spheroids.

These studies support the feasibility of our planned experiments, including antigen-specific cytotoxicity assays, PDO studies, organ-on-a-chip safety screens, and in vivo pharmacology/toxicology.

Phase I (Year 1): Mechanistic Efficacy and Human-Relevant Safety

**Aim 1. Quantify real-time cytotoxicity and immune activation induced by CBT-611H + carboplatin in platinum-resistant HGSOC spheroids/organoids.**

Rationale: CAR-T success in HGSOC will require robust killing of cisplatin-resistant tumor cells and sustained T-cell activation in the presence of carboplatin. The use of well-characterized HGSOC spheroids/organoids with defined DCLK1 surface expression will allow for quantitative dissection of CBT-611H + carboplatin combinatorial activity.

Experimental Design: OVCAR3 (intrinsically platinum-resistant), OVCAR8 CPR (cisplatin-resistant, DCLK1⁺), and OVCAR8 CPR DCLK1-knockout cells will be used in the following experiments. A. We will grow the cell lines described above as 3D spheroids and organoid-like aggregates using ultra–low-attachment or Matrigel-based systems. B. We will quantify DCLK1 surface expression by flow cytometry and immunoblotting. We will confirm DCLK1 knockout in OVCAR8 CPR DCLK1-knockout cells by immunoblot and sequencing. C. We will treat spheroids/organoids as described below: • Group 1: vehicle control. • Group 2: carboplatin alone (dose range approximating clinically achievable Cmax). • Group 3: CBT-611H alone (effector: target [E:T] ratios 1:1, 5:1, 10:1). • Group 4: CBT-611H plus carboplatin (pre-treat tumor cells with carboplatin for 24 h, then add CAR-T cells). • Group 5: mock CAR-T control. D. Real-time cytotoxicity will be assessed using the IncuCyte live-cell imaging system to quantify spheroid size, viability, and % cytolysis over 24–96 h. Viability will be assessed using the 3D CellTiter-Glo assay at 48–72 h to confirm IncuCyte results. E. Cytokine production will be determined by measuring IFN-γ, IL-2, IL-6, TNF-α (and exploratory panels) in supernatants at 24 h and 48 h via ELISA or multiplex bead assays. F. T-cell activation and exhaustion will be determined by flow cytometry for CD69 and CD25 (activation) and PD-1, LAG-3, TIM-3 (exhaustion) at 24–72 h. G. CAR-T proliferation will be evaluated using CellTrace Violet dilution after 3–5 days of co-culture to quantify proliferative responses. H. Statistical analysis will be performed using one-way or two-way ANOVA (treatment × time) with Tukey or Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. Data will be transformed as needed to satisfy assumptions; non-parametric Kruskal–Wallis tests will be used when appropriate. I. Expected Outcomes. We predict that CBT-611H will show robust, DCLK1-dependent killing of cisplatin-resistant spheroids, with enhanced cytotoxicity and cytokine production in combination with carboplatin. DCLK1-knockout controls will show minimal killing, confirming antigen specificity. Data will define minimal antigen density and optimal E:T ratios for efficacy and inform dosing for PDO (Aim 2) and in vivo studies (Aim 5).

**Aim 2. Define the therapeutic efficacy and CAR-T specificity of CBT-611H ± carboplatin in patient-derived ovarian cancer organoids (PDOs).**

Rationale: Patient-derived organoids from platinum-resistant HGSOC ascites capture inter-patient heterogeneity and CSC content. Testing CBT-611H ± carboplatin in PDOs provides a human, clinically relevant platform to examine CSC depletion and CAR-T specificity across a clinically diverse set of tumors.

Experimental Design: A. PDOs will be generated from ascites obtained from platinum-resistant HGSOC patients under an IRB-approved protocol. B. PDOs will be established in 3D culture and expanded to generate ≥ 20–25 independent lines, each representing a patient. C. Baseline characterization of DCLK1 surface expression will be quantified by flow cytometry and IHC (FFPE pellets). CSC markers (e.g., ALDH1A1, CD133) will be measured by flow cytometry and imaging. PDOs with high DCLK1 expression (top quartile) and PDOs with low DCLK1 expression (bottom quartile) will be used in all experiments. D. PDOs will be treated as described below: • Group 1: vehicle control. • Group 2: carboplatin alone (standard clinically relevant dose). • Group 3: CBT-611H alone (E:T ratios 1:1, 5:1, 10:1). • Group 4: CBT-611H plus carboplatin (pre-treat tumor cells with carboplatin for 24 h, then add CAR-T cells). • Group 5: mock CAR-T control. E. Spheroid/organoid viability will be assessed by 3D CellTiter-Glo assay at 72 h, normalized to untreated control. F. CSC depletion will be assessed via % reduction in DCLK1⁺, ALDH1A1⁺, and CD133⁺ cells by flow cytometry and high-content imaging. G. Immune activation and cytokines will be determined by multiplex ELISA for IFN-γ, IL-2, TNF-α, and IL-6 in supernatants. H. CAR-T persistence and phenotype will be determined by CAR expression, memory phenotype (CD45RA/CCR7), and exhaustion markers in recovered T cells. I. Statistical Analysis. Each condition will be performed in triplicate technical replicates and repeated in ≥ 3 biological replicates per PDO line. One- or two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc tests will be used to compare treatments. J. Exploratory correlation analyses (linear regression, Spearman) will be used to associate baseline DCLK1 surface expression with treatment responses (viability, CSC depletion, cytokines) strictly to confirm antigen specificity and CSC targeting, not to derive a clinical predictive biomarker. K. Expected Outcomes. We predict that CBT-611H will show selective cytotoxicity and CSC depletion in DCLK1⁺ PDOs, with enhanced effects in combination with carboplatin in PDOs with high DCLK1 cell-surface expression (top quartile) compared to DCLK1-low PDOs (bottom quartile). We expect DCLK1 expression will correlate with CAR-T–mediated killing and CSC depletion, supporting CBT-611H specificity. L. Potential Problems and Alternatives. If PDO derivation yields fewer than anticipated lines, we will expand accrual and supplement with additional archival ascites samples. If some PDOs lack measurable DCLK1 expression, they will serve as negative controls for CBT-611H specificity.

**Aim 3. Assess multiplex safety of CBT-611H ± carboplatin using human microphysiologic (organ-on-a-chip) platforms.**

Rationale: DCLK1 isoforms 2 and 4 are upregulated in several solid tumors but may also be expressed at low levels in select normal tissues, including the nervous system. CAR-T therapies directed against antigens with neural or other normal-tissue expression can cause on-target, off-tumor toxicity. Human microphysiologic organ-on-a-chip platforms enable parallel, human-relevant safety assessment ahead of in vivo IND-enabling studies and allow direct quantification of DCLK1 expression and potential CBT-611H engagement in normal compartments.

Experimental Design: A. We will use commercial microphysiologic systems (e.g., MIMETAS or EMULATE) representing key organs at risk, including brain (neuronal + glial co-cultures), liver (hepatocyte + non-parenchymal cells), kidney (proximal tubule, glomerular), heart (cardiomyocytes), lung (airway or alveolar epithelium), and gastrointestinal epithelium. DCLK1 surface expression will be quantified in each chip by immunofluorescence and flow cytometry, where feasible, to establish normal-tissue baseline levels. B. Each chip type will be tested under the following conditions: (1) vehicle control; (2) carboplatin alone; (3) CBT-611H alone; (4) CBT-611H plus carboplatin; (5) mock CAR-T control. C. Tissue injury and function will be evaluated by determining barrier integrity (intestine), albumin production (liver), creatinine levels (kidney), contractility metrics (heart), and neuronal apoptosis and viability assays (brain) over 3–7 days. D. We will critically assess DCLK1-dependent engagement by determining CAR-T localization (imaging, T-cell markers) and evidence of tissue-specific injury in DCLK1⁺ vs. negligible-DCLK1 chips. E. Cytokine release will be determined using multiplex cytokine/chemokine panels in effluent media to assess CRS-like profiles. F. Statistical analysis will be performed using mixed-effects or repeated-measures ANOVA (treatment × time) for functional and viability readouts. Comparisons of CBT-611H vs. CBT-611H + carboplatin vs. controls will be determined for each organ type.

Expected Outcomes: We predict that in most normal-tissue chips, DCLK1 expression will be rare, with the possible exception of the brain. As such, we expect minimal on-target, off-tumor toxicity. In the brain, however, where DCLK1 is more abundant, our preliminary data demonstrate that normal neuronal epithelium primarily expresses human isoforms 1/3 that do not contain the extracellular domain epitopes targeted by CBT-611H. Nonetheless, these proposed studies will accurately evaluate neuronal injury and CRS metrics and will inform the design of subsequent in vivo IND-enabling studies.

**Phase II (Years 2–3):** Manufacturing scale-up and pre-IND-enabling in vivo pharmacology and toxicology

Research Plan – Phase II Preclinical data obtained from Phase I studies will establish that CBT-611H, a DCLK1-directed CAR-T, selectively recognizes and eradicates DCLK1⁺ chemo-resistant spheroids alone and in combination with carboplatin. Furthermore, they will demonstrate that patient-derived organoids obtained from the ascitic fluid of patients with high DCLK1 are vulnerable to CBT-611H ± carboplatin. Moreover, we predict that Phase I studies will demonstrate an acceptable safety and toxicity profile based on organ-on-a-chip assays. These proof-of-concept studies (POC) support the hypothesis that precise targeting of DCLK1⁺ cancer stem-like cells can prevent or reverse platinum-resistant relapse in HGSOC while minimizing off-tumor on-target toxicity.

**Specific Aim 4 will develop and lock a scalable, closed, pre-GMP manufacturing process and analytical release panel that are directly translatable to full cGMP production and will provide sufficient material for the studies described in Aim 5** (see letter from Promab). Specific Aim 5 will conduct pre-IND-enabling pharmacology, biodistribution, and pre-GLP-compliant safety/toxicology studies in humanized NSG models of DCLK1⁺ HGSOC, integrating efficacy, persistence, biodistribution, cytokine release, and organ-specific toxicities. Together, these efforts will define the therapeutic index, NOAELs, and recommended starting dose and dose-escalation schema for CBT-611H ± carboplatin.

**A. Significance (Phase II context)****:** HGSOC remains the deadliest gynecologic malignancy. Most women present with advanced, metastatic disease and ultimately die of platinum-resistant relapse despite initial responses to surgery and platinum/taxane chemotherapy. Current options for recurrent platinum-resistant HGSOC yield low response rates and progression-free survival measured in only months, with cumulative toxicities and no durable disease control. Patients in this setting urgently need mechanism-based therapies that can overcome resistance and deliver lasting benefit.

Despite the remarkable success of CD19- and BCMA-directed CAR-T cells in hematologic malignancies, currently there are no FDA-approved CAR-T therapies for ovarian cancer or any solid tumor. Major barriers include antigen heterogeneity, on-target/off-tumor toxicity, hostile tumor microenvironments, inadequate CAR-T tumor infiltration and persistence, and manufacturing complexity. CBT-611H is designed to overcome these barriers by: (i) focusing on DCLK1 isoforms 2/4, which are enriched in tumor-initiating cell populations and minimally expressed in normal adult tissues; (ii) combining CAR-T therapy with carboplatin to debulk tumor burden and modulate the tumor microenvironment; and (iii) using intraperitoneal delivery to concentrate CAR-T cells within the peritoneal cavity where HGSOC metastases reside, thus potentially increasing efficacy while limiting systemic exposure and off-tumor risk, including neurotoxicity.

The overarching goal of this Phase II application is to move CBT-611H from a robust laboratory proof-of-concept to an IND-ready product candidate.

**B. Innovation (Phase II context)****:** This Phase II program is innovative at the levels of biology, therapeutic modality, clinical strategy, and translational design. CBT-611H exploits the unique biology of DCLK1 isoforms 2 and 4 as markers of cancer stem-like cells in HGSOC that express a short extracellular targeting epitope. Rather than targeting bulk tumor antigens that are variably expressed and dispensable for tumor maintenance, CBT-611H focuses on a stemness-associated antigen that is implicated in self-renewal, epithelial–mesenchymal transition, and therapy resistance.

The therapeutic modality and delivery strategy are also innovative. The CAR construct and culture conditions are optimized to favor a central memory or early effector phenotype that supports persistence and durability. We have developed preliminary data demonstrating real-time cytotoxicity in HGSOC that express elevated DCLK1 on the cell surface, whereas HGSOC cells in which DCLK1 was deleted via CRISPR/Cas9 did not exhibit any cytotoxicity following treatment with CBT-611H. Furthermore, we demonstrated that CBT-611H treatment in a preclinical model of HGSOC derived from DCLK1-overexpressing cells reduced tumor size and metastasis while demonstrating immune invasion of the tumors as well as CAR-T persistence.

Intraperitoneal delivery concentrates CBT-611H within the peritoneal cavity, aligning the therapeutic with the biology of HGSOC dissemination and potentially lowering systemic and neurologic toxicity. Carboplatin functions not only as standard-of-care chemotherapy but as a rational partner that can debulk tumor mass, increase antigen release, and modulate the tumor microenvironment in ways that may synergize with CAR-T–mediated cytotoxicity.

From a translational perspective, the project tightly integrates pre-IND process development in Aim 4 with IND-enabling pharmacology and toxicology in Aim 5. A semi-automated, closed-system CAR-T manufacturing process using lentiviral vectors, bead-based activation, defined MOI transduction, and gas-permeable bioreactors will be locked prior to nonclinical studies. A comprehensive analytical release and stability panel covering identity, potency, purity, safety, and functional stability will ensure that in vivo pharmacology and toxicology are performed with product that closely mirrors future cGMP lots and supports analytical comparability at the time of IND.

The *in vivo* evaluation is similarly innovative. Humanized NSG models will recapitulate key aspects of the human immune system and peritoneal HGSOC metastasis, allowing simultaneous assessment of efficacy, trafficking and persistence, biodistribution, cytokine release, and organ-specific toxicity within a single integrated platform. Biodistribution will be quantified via CAR transgene qPCR and flow cytometry across blood and major organs, including brain, to directly address the risk of on-target or off-tumor neurotoxicity. Cytokine profiles will be benchmarked against clinical CAR-T experience to estimate the risk of CRS.

Finally, the program incorporates regulatory and commercial innovation. By intentionally aligning CMC, recommended starting dose, and nonclinical work with regulatory expectations—including definition of NOAEL, therapeutic index, and analytical comparability between pre-IND and future GMP lots—this program positions CBT-611H plus carboplatin as a scalable, first-in-class product candidate. The same manufacturing platform and analytical suite can be rapidly adapted to additional DCLK1-driven indications, creating a modular DCLK1-targeted immunotherapy franchise.

**APPROACH** 

**Aim 4****.**** Develop and qualify a scalable pre-GMP manufacturing process and analytical release panel for CBT-611H for use in animal studies and future GMP translation.**

Rationale: Clinical translation of CBT-611H requires a scalable, reproducible, and regulatory-compatible manufacturing process for both the lentiviral vector (LVV) and CAR-T product. Locking a closed, semi-automated pre-GMP process and associated analytical panel in Phase II ensures that pre-IND-enabling pharmacology/toxicology studies are conducted with material comparable to future cGMP lots and that analytical comparability can be demonstrated during technology transfer to a commercial CDMO.

Experimental Design: • Task 4.1: Lentiviral Vector Production (GMP-compatible). Suspension-adapted HEK293T cells in chemically defined serum-free media will be transfected with a four-plasmid system (gag-pol, rev, VSV-G, and a self-inactivating CBT-611H transfer vector). We will optimize DNA:reagent ratios, cell density at transfection, harvest windows, and purification using depth filtration followed by tangential-flow filtration and anion-exchange chromatography. Release controls will include p24 ELISA, functional titer on Jurkat or primary T cells, residual host-cell DNA/protein, replication-competent lentivirus, sterility, and endotoxin. • Task 4.2: CAR-T Manufacturing Process Development. Healthy donor leukapheresis material will be used for process development, with subsequent engineering runs on patient-derived material to demonstrate comparability. CD3/CD28 bead-based activation, defined multiplicity of infection (MOI 2–5), and IL-7/IL-15 support will favor a central memory phenotype. Expansion in G-Rex or equivalent gas-permeable bioreactors will minimize handling and shear stress. Process parameters (cell density, media formulation, gas exchange, feeding schedule, and culture duration) will be optimized to maximize yield while preserving phenotype and function. Standardized cryopreservation (e.g., CryoStor-based solution, controlled-rate freezing, vapor-phase liquid nitrogen storage) will be implemented to model the intended clinical supply chain. • Task 4.3: Analytical Release and Stability Panel. We will develop and qualify an analytical panel that defines the identity, potency, safety, and purity or quality of CBT-611H. Identity will be established by measuring CAR surface expression and T-cell subset distribution with multiparameter flow cytometry. Potency will be assessed by real-time cytotoxicity assays against DCLK1-positive and DCLK1-negative targets and by quantifying cytokine production. Safety will be confirmed through sterility testing, mycoplasma assays, assays for replication-competent lentivirus, and endotoxin measurements. Purity and overall product quality will be evaluated by determining vector copy number (with a target of no more than five copies per genome), measuring residual bead carryover, and ensuring a viability of at least 80%. Stability will be assessed at 0, 3, and 6 months post-cryopreservation by re-evaluating viability, phenotype, and potency under frozen storage conditions that mirror clinical distribution.

**Expected Outcomes, Success Criteria, and Milestones:** • Milestone 4.1 (Vector Process Lock): Successful development of a scalable LVV production process with a minimum titer of 1 × 10^8 TU/mL (pre-purification) and a recovery yield of ≥ 20% post-chromatography, meeting all pre-defined release specifications (functional titer, sterility, RCL-negative, endotoxin < 5 EU/mL, residual DNA < 10 ng/dose) across three consecutive engineering runs. • Milestone 4.2 (CAR-T Process Lock): Establishment of a robust CAR-T manufacturing process that consistently yields a final product meeting the following success criteria from healthy donor starting material across a minimum of five independent runs: – Viability: ≥ 80% at harvest and post-thaw. – Yield: ≥ 1.0 × 10^9 total CAR⁺ T cells, enabling sufficient dosing for toxicology studies. – Transduction Efficiency: ≥ 40% CAR expression by flow cytometry. – Phenotype: ≥ 40% of CAR⁺ cells exhibit a central/early memory phenotype (CD45RO⁺CD62L⁺ or CCR7⁺). – Vector Copy Number (VCN): ≤ 5 copies per genome (mean). – Potency: In vitro specific lysis of ≥ 50% of DCLK1⁺ target cells at a 10:1 E:T ratio in a 4-hour assay, with minimal activity (< 15% lysis) against DCLK1-negative controls. • Milestone 4.3 (Panel Qualification & Stability): Successful qualification of the analytical release panel, demonstrating precision (inter-assay CV < 20% for potency, < 15% for other quantitative assays) and accuracy. Successful demonstration of product stability for at least 6 months in clinical-grade cryopreservation, with post-thaw viability ≥ 70%, CAR expression retention ≥ 80% of baseline, and maintenance of in vitro potency. • Milestone 4.4 (Process Comparability): Demonstration of comparable critical quality attributes (CQAs) between CAR-T products manufactured from ≥ 3 healthy donor and ≥ 2 patient-derived starting materials using the locked process. Statistical analysis (e.g., unpaired t-test or equivalence testing with pre-defined margins) will show no significant difference (p > 0.05) in key parameters (VCN, transduction efficiency, potency, memory phenotype).

**Potential Pitfalls and Mitigations:** Pitfall 1: Low or Variable LVV Titer, which could delay CAR-T process development. Mitigation: Implement high-throughput screening of transfection parameters and plasmid ratios; evaluate alternative transfection reagents or producer cell lines as a backup. Pitfall 2: Inconsistent CAR-T Product Phenotype/Potency, which could lead to failure in animal studies. Mitigation: Systematically map the impact of activation duration, cytokine concentration, and feeding regimens on phenotype; implement in-process monitoring (e.g., metabolite analysis) to guide process adjustments. Pitfall 3: High or Variable Vector Copy Number (VCN), which raises safety concerns. Mitigation: Tightly control MOI using accurately titrated vector; evaluate the impact of transduction enhancers; implement ddPCR with rigorous standards for VCN analysis. Pitfall 4: Inadequate Cryopreservation Recovery, which compromises product delivery. Mitigation: Test multiple cryoprotectant formulations and controlled-rate freezing profiles; correlate post-thaw recovery with pre-freeze cell health metrics.

**Statistical Considerations:** For process optimization (Tasks 4.1, 4.2), a Design of Experiments (DoE) approach will be employed to model the impact of multiple variables (e.g., cell density, DNA amount, media feed timing) on critical outputs (titer, yield, phenotype). For comparability assessment (Milestone 4.4), sample sizes (n ≥ 3 per group) are chosen to provide 80% power to detect a 25% difference in key CQAs, with significance set at p < 0.05.

**Overall Aim 4 Success:** The successful completion of this aim will be defined by the delivery of three consecutive, specification-compliant, pre-GMP lots of CBT-611H manufactured using the locked process and fully characterized by the qualified analytical panel. This material will be used directly in IND-enabling toxicology studies, and a complete Technology Transfer Package—including SOPs, batch records, and analytical methods—will be prepared for CDMO handoff. This directly enables the nonclinical pharmacology/toxicology components of the IND.

**Scientific Rigor and Reproducibility****:** Standard operating procedures will govern all in vitro studies, microphysiologic system experiments, manufacturing activities, and in vivo protocols. Cell lines and patient-derived organoids will be authenticated and regularly tested for mycoplasma. Animal assignments will be randomized, and investigators who assess tumor burden, pathology, and clinical chemistry will be blinded to treatment groups. In vitro assays will be performed in biological triplicate, and key findings such as PDO responses, microphysiologic safety signals, and in vivo efficacy will be reproduced in independent experiments. Negative controls, including DCLK1-negative cell lines, mock CAR-T cells, and isotype antibodies, and positive controls such as known cytotoxic agents will be included in all critical assays. Data will be recorded in 21 CFR Part 11–compliant electronic laboratory notebooks with full audit trails. Together, these measures will ensure that the data generated in Phase II are robust, reproducible, and interpretable and will maximize the likelihood that successful completion of this Fast-Track will support an approvable IND for CBT-611H plus carboplatin in DCLK1-selected platinum-resistant HGSOC.

**Specific Aim 5. Conduct pre-IND-enabling pharmacology, efficacy, biodistribution, and safety studies of CBT-611H ± carboplatin in humanized NSG models.**

Rationale: Successful IND submission for CBT-611H will require in vivo data demonstrating: (i) anti-tumor activity in a clinically relevant human immune–competent context; (ii) acceptable safety margins and tolerability of CBT-611H alone and in combination with carboplatin; and (iii) biodistribution and persistence consistent with on-target activity and a manageable risk of off-tumor toxicity or CRS. Humanized NSG mice engrafted with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and bearing DCLK1⁺, luciferase-expressing HGSOC xenografts provide a tractable system to evaluate efficacy, pharmacology, and safety of human CAR-T cells while recapitulating key elements of the human immune environment. Data from this aim will directly inform the projected clinical starting dose, dose-escalation strategy, and safety monitoring plan for a first-in-human trial.

Experimental Design Objective: We will first establish and characterize a humanized NSG peritoneal HGSOC-Luc model.

Task 5.1. NSG mice will be engrafted with well-characterized human PBMC preparations. Mice will receive intraperitoneal injections of DCLK1⁺, luciferase labeled HGSOC cells. Engraftment and early tumor growth will be monitored non-invasively using serial in vivo bioluminescent imaging (BLI).

Task 5.2. Group 1: vehicle control–treated humanized HGSOC-Luc mice will be evaluated for tumor kinetics, tumor burden by BLI, ascites formation, weight loss, peritoneal tumor burden, and metastatic spread to liver, spleen, diaphragm, omentum, ovaries, bowel, and distant organs. These parameters will be assessed via BLI at specified time points and at necropsy.

Task 5.3. Group 2: carboplatin-treated mice (dose to be determined based on prior studies) will be evaluated as described in Task 5.2.

Task 5.4. Group 3: CBT-611H–treated mice (dose levels informed by Aims 1–3) will be injected intraperitoneally into tumor-bearing mice as described in Tasks 5.2 and 5.3.

Task 5.5. Group 4: carboplatin will be administered to tumor-bearing mice followed by CBT-611H four hours later. Mice will then be evaluated as described above.

Task 5.6. Group 5: mock CAR-T controls will be administered to tumor-bearing mice and evaluated as described above.

For efficacy experiments, humanized mice bearing HGSOC DCLK1-Luc tumors will be randomized into the groups described above (Groups 1–5) once tumors reach a defined range of BLI signal. In Group 4, carboplatin will be given 4 hours prior to CAR-T injections to modulate the immune tumor microenvironment and to avoid carboplatin-mediated effects on T-cell viability and proliferation.

Task 5.7. CBT-611H will be evaluated at dose levels selected from in vitro potency and earlier in vivo studies (Aims 2–3) to span the anticipated clinical exposure range. Clinical parameters—including body weight, ascites, activity, and survival—will be monitored throughout. At protocol-specified interim and terminal time points, mice will be sacrificed for comprehensive assessment of tumor burden. Peritoneal nodules will be counted and measured; a peritoneal carcinomatosis index will be computed; and metastases in visceral and distant organs will be recorded. Tumor and metastatic lesions will be processed for immunohistochemistry or immunofluorescence to assess DCLK1 expression, epithelial markers, proliferation (Ki-67), apoptosis (cleaved caspase-3), and the frequency of residual DCLK1⁺ cancer stem-like cells. Together, these data will define the depth and durability of response to CBT-611H alone and in combination with carboplatin.

Task 5.8. We will characterize CBT-611H biodistribution, persistence, and effects on the immune/tumor microenvironment.

Task 5.9. At serial time points after infusion, peripheral blood will be collected to quantify circulating CAR-T cells by flow cytometry and vector copy number by quantitative PCR.

Task 5.10. At necropsy, tumor, peritoneal lavage, spleen, bone marrow, liver, lung, and lymphoid tissues will be harvested. These specimens will be analyzed for CAR-T infiltration and phenotype, including memory and exhaustion markers, and for endogenous human immune subsets such as CD8⁺ effector T cells, regulatory T cells, NK cells, and myeloid populations. Multiplex immunostaining will be used to map the spatial distribution of CAR-T cells relative to DCLK1⁺ tumor regions and to evaluate changes in stromal and immune architecture. Plasma will be analyzed for human cytokines and chemokines (e.g., IL-6, IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-2, IL-10, and others) to assess systemic pharmacodynamic activation and CRS risk.

Safety, tolerability, and toxicity of CBT-611H alone and in combination with carboplatin will be rigorously evaluated during the study. Mice will be followed daily for survival, weight loss, grooming, activity, posture, and other clinical signs, with pre-defined stopping rules for humane endpoints. At scheduled time points and at necropsy, blood will be collected for clinical pathology, including complete blood counts and serum chemistries that capture hepatic, renal, and metabolic function. Comprehensive necropsies will be performed with histologic evaluation of major organs—liver, kidney, lung, heart, brain, gastrointestinal tract, ovary/uterus, bone marrow, spleen, and lymphoid tissues—to detect and grade off-tumor/on-target injury, off-target toxicity, CAR-T–associated organ damage, or graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)–like pathology arising from PBMC humanization. Integrating clinical observations, clinical pathology, cytokine profiles, and histopathology across dose levels and treatment arms will allow us to estimate a NOAEL for CBT-611H monotherapy and combination therapy. These findings will be combined with in vitro potency and pharmacology data to support calculation of a projected first-in-human starting dose and a rational dose-escalation schema for the planned Phase I trial.

**Milestones and go/no-go criteria**: By the end of the first project year, we expect to have established a robust humanized peritoneal HGSOC-Luc model in which at least a pre-specified majority of engrafted NSG mice demonstrate stable human immune reconstitution and reproducible peritoneal tumor engraftment with measurable BLI signals and a well-defined natural history of disease. By mid-Phase II, CBT-611H monotherapy should produce statistically significant reductions in BLI tumor burden and improvements in survival compared with vehicle and CAR-T control, accompanied by reduced peritoneal carcinomatosis and ascites. The CBT-611H plus carboplatin combination is expected to further deepen and/or prolong responses relative to each monotherapy.

Milestones for biodistribution and pharmacology include consistent detection of CAR-T cells in blood and tumor/peritoneal compartments over a defined minimum persistence window, preferential accumulation in tumor versus off-target organs, and cytokine profiles that remain within ranges anticipated to be manageable clinically. The aim will be considered successful when an integrated dataset supports a defensible NOAEL for CBT-611H alone and in combination with carboplatin, along with a coherent translational narrative for dosing and safety monitoring in the IND.

**Potential problems and alternative strategies****:** A key risk is variability in human immune reconstitution or early onset of PBMC-driven GVHD, which could confound attribution of toxicity and limit the observation window for efficacy. To mitigate this, we will use standardized PBMC donor lots, enroll only animals exceeding a pre-defined threshold of human CD45⁺ cells, and optimize the interval between humanization, tumor inoculation, and CAR-T infusion to minimize GVHD during the critical efficacy window. Histopathologic criteria will be used to distinguish GVHD from CAR-T–mediated organ injury. If PBMC humanization proves unstable or overly toxic, we will pivot to a CD34⁺ hematopoietic stem cell–based humanization platform with lower GVHD risk.

A second risk is suboptimal tumor engraftment or lack of the desired peritoneal dissemination pattern. In this case, we will refine inoculum conditions and, if necessary, evaluate alternative DCLK1⁺ HGSOC lines or patient-derived xenografts, including orthotopic ovarian implantation, to preserve biological relevance. If CBT-611H persistence or trafficking to tumor sites is inadequate under the initial regimen, we will adjust lymphodepletion and dosing schedules, within safety constraints, to enhance expansion and durability, including consideration of repeat dosing paradigms. Conversely, if excessive toxicity or CRS-like events occur at the planned dose levels, we will implement pre-specified dose de-escalations and altered combination timing while preserving the ability to estimate clinically relevant exposures and NOAEL.

**Statistical considerations**: Group sizes will be determined by power analyses based on effect sizes observed in prior in vivo CBT-611H studies, with the goal of achieving at least 80% power to detect clinically meaningful differences in primary endpoints at a two-sided α of 0.05. Animals will be randomized to treatment arms once they reach the target BLI range, and imaging and pathology assessments will be performed under blinded conditions where feasible. Longitudinal BLI tumor burden will be analyzed using mixed-effects models or repeated-measures ANOVA, with treatment arm as a fixed effect and animal as a random effect, followed by pre-specified pairwise comparisons with adjustment for multiple testing. Overall survival will be analyzed using Kaplan–Meier methods with log-rank tests and Cox proportional hazards models to estimate hazard ratios and to evaluate interaction between CBT-611H and carboplatin.

Continuous secondary endpoints, such as tumor mass, ascites volume, cytokine concentrations, and laboratory values, will be compared using parametric or non-parametric tests as appropriate, while ordinal pathology scores and categorical outcomes will be assessed using non-parametric methods and contingency analyses. Interaction terms in survival and tumor-burden models will be used to formally test whether the combination regimen provides benefit beyond the additive effects of monotherapies. Exclusion criteria for analyses (e.g., failure of humanization, lack of tumor engraftment, mis-randomization) will be defined a priori, and both intent-to-treat and per-protocol analyses will be reported to ensure robustness.
