NIH has no active Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) or Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) solicitations because the legislative authority for the programs expired on October 1, 2025. Current recipients should direct any questions to their Program Officer. See [NOT-OD-26-006](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-26-006.html).

NCI SBIR/STTR Grants
====================


NCI offers different types of SBIR and STTR grant opportunities. Most grant requirements allow applications with an investigator-defined scope that is within the  [mission of the National Institutes of Health (NIH)](http://www.nih.gov/about/mission.htm). NCI’s research areas of interest include:

* Therapeutics (e.g., small molecules, biologics, radiomodulators, and cell-based therapies)
* *In vitro* and *in vivo* diagnostics (e.g., companion diagnostics and prognostic technologies)
* Imaging technologies (e.g., agents, devices, and image-guided interventions)
* Devices for cancer therapy (e.g., interventional devices, surgical, radiation, and ablative therapies)
* Tools for cancer biology research
* Technologies and agents for cancer prevention
* Technologies for cancer control (e.g., behavioral health interventions, tools for genetic, epidemiologic, behavioral, social, and/or surveillance cancer research)
* Digital health (e.g., mobile health, health information, technology, and bioinformatics)
