![]()

**Grantboost** is an AI-powered grant writing platform designed specifically for nonprofits, aiming to streamline the grant proposal process and enhance efficiency.

What started as a beta tool rapidly grew to serve over 5,000 grant writing teams, processing more than 3.5 million words monthly.

**2) ChatGPT - Best AI Writing Assistant**
------------------------------------------

![]()

ChatGPT is the world’s most widely used AI assistant. While not specifically designed for grants, its flexibility makes it a popular tool among resource-constrained nonprofits.

### **Key Features for Grant Writing**

* **Custom Prompt Flexibility**: ChatGPT responds to detailed instructions, allowing you to specify tone, format, and content requirements for different grant sections.

### **Considerations Before Using ChatGPT for Grants**

ChatGPT requires well-crafted prompts to produce useful grant content. You’ll need to provide detailed context about your organization and the specific grant opportunity. The quality of output depends heavily on how well you can articulate what you need.

Additionally, ChatGPT may occasionally generate inaccurate information or misunderstand complex nonprofit terminology. All content should be carefully reviewed by someone familiar with your organization and the grant requirements.

### **Pricing starts at $0.**

* **ChatGPT Plus**: $20/month for priority access, faster responses, and access to GPT-4 capabilities

### **Considerations Before Using Claude for Grant Writing**

While Claude excels at technical writing, it may require more specific guidance for capturing your organization’s unique voice and mission. The interface is also somewhat less intuitive than ChatGPT for first-time users.

As with all AI tools, Claude’s outputs should be carefully reviewed for accuracy and alignment with your organization’s actual programs and capabilities.

### **Pricing starts at $0.**

* **Claude Free**: Basic access with some usage limitations
* **Claude Pro**: $17/month for priority access during high usage periods, higher message limits, and faster response times

**4) Jasper - Marketing-Focused AI Writing Tool**
-------------------------------------------------

![]()

Founded in 2021 as Jarvis and later rebranded, Jasper has become a leading AI platform for marketing-focused content creation. While primarily designed for marketing teams, Jasper’s emphasis on brand voice consistency makes it valuable for nonprofits wanting to maintain a cohesive narrative across all grant applications.

### **Key Features for Enhanced Grant Writing**

* **Brand Voice Training**: Jasper can be trained on your existing content to learn and replicate your organization’s unique communication style across all grant materials.

* **Chrome Extension**: Allows you to generate drafts or refine content directly within grant application portals or shared documents.

### **Considerations Before Using Jasper for Grants**

Jasper’s marketing focus means you’ll need to carefully adapt its features for grant writing purposes. The platform has a steeper learning curve than some alternatives, and its higher price point may be prohibitive for smaller nonprofits.

The emphasis on persuasive marketing language may need to be toned down for more formal grant applications, particularly for government or academic funders.

### **Pricing starts at $39/month (when paid annually)**

* **Creator**: $39/month per seat, includes basic AI writing features and one Brand Voice
* **Pro**: $59/month per seat, adds team collaboration features and multiple Brand Voices

**5) Instrumentl - Comprehensive Grant Research & Management**
--------------------------------------------------------------

![]()

* **Automated Deadline Reminders**: Never miss application deadlines or reporting requirements with automated reminders.

### **Considerations Before Using Instrumentl**

Instrumentl’s comprehensive approach comes at a higher price point that may be challenging for smaller nonprofits. The platform’s robust feature set also means a steeper learning curve for new users.

While the AI writing features are promising, they’re newer additions to the platform and may not be as refined as tools focused exclusively on content generation.

* **Basic**: $179/month (billed annually) for organizations with budgets under $500k
* **Standard**: $299/month (billed annually) with expanded features

**6) Notion - Collaborative Grant Development**
-----------------------------------------------

![]()

Notion AI integrates artificial intelligence directly into Notion’s flexible workspace environment.

### **Considerations Before Using Notion AI for Grants**

Notion has a learning curve for teams not already familiar with the platform. The AI features are integrated into the broader Notion ecosystem, so you’ll need to adopt the entire platform rather than just using the AI components.

While powerful for organization and collaboration, Notion AI’s writing capabilities aren’t as specialized for grant writing as some dedicated tools like Grantboost!

### **Pricing starts at $10/month.**

* **Notion Basic**: Free for personal use with limited features
* **Notion AI**: $10/member/month (billed annually) or $12/member/month (billed monthly)

**7) Grammarly - Polishing Perfect Grant Proposals**
----------------------------------------------------

![]()

Founded in 2009, Grammarly has evolved from a simple grammar checker to an AI-powered writing assistant used by over 50,000 organizations. While not grant-specific, Grammarly helps nonprofits ensure their proposals are clear, professional, and error-free.

Grammarly stands out for its ability to not just correct errors but improve the overall quality, tone, and impact of your writing. It’s essential for creating grant proposals that impress funders in a way that doesn’t intefere with your natural writing style.

### **Key Features for Enhancing Grant Clarity**

* **Advanced Grammar and Style Checking**: Goes beyond basic spell-check to identify complex grammar issues, wordiness, passive voice, and other writing problems that could weaken your proposal.
* **Tone Adjustment**: Analyzes and helps modify the tone of your writing to match the formality and style expected by different funders.

* **Browser Extension and Integration**: Works directly in grant portals, Google Docs, Microsoft Word, and other writing platforms.

### **Considerations Before Using Grammarly for Grants**

Grammarly focuses on improving existing content rather than generating new material. You’ll still need to create the initial draft of your grant proposal.

While excellent for general writing improvement, Grammarly lacks specialized knowledge of grant writing conventions or nonprofit terminology.

### **Pricing starts at $0.**

* **Free**: Basic writing suggestions and corrections
* **Premium**: $12/month per user (billed annually, $30 if paid monthly) for advanced features including tone adjustment and clarity enhancements
* **Business**: Custom pricing for team features and administrative controls

![]()

Launched in 2023 as the successor to Google Bard, Gemini represents Google’s most advanced AI system. It excels at integrating real-time information and data analysis into grant narratives for teams needing to incorporate current research and statistics.

### **Considerations Before Using Google Gemini for Grants**

As a newer AI system, Gemini is still evolving and may have inconsistencies in output quality. Its integration benefits are strongest for organizations already using Google Workspace tools.

Like other general AI assistants, Gemini requires clear guidance to produce grant-specific content that meets professional standards.

### **Pricing starts at $0.**

* **Gemini Free**: Basic access to AI features
* **Gemini Advanced**: $19.99/month for access to more powerful AI models and additional features

For very small nonprofits with limited grant activity, the structured approach may feel like overkill compared to simpler tracking methods.
