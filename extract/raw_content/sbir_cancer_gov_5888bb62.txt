How to Write a Good Specific Aims Page
======================================

#### This NCI SBIR PLAN Webinar Series focuses on: How to Write a Good Specific Aims Page

The specific aims page is a critical part of an SBIR/STTR application. The aims page should be treated as a standalone page from which a reviewer can gain a reasonable understanding of the critical components of the project without reading any other parts of the application.

The first half of the aims page should cover key background information, highlighting the product, its significance, and innovation. The second half of the aims page should state the specific aims and milestones to be completed. Applicants are only allowed one-page for their specific aims.

In this PLAN series, prior SBIR/STTR awardees with a variety of cancer technology products such as therapeutics, diagnostics, devices, and digital health explain how they tackled various issues related to writing a good specific aims page, including but not limited to adding quantitative milestones, writing aims page for fast track or phase 2 applications, and more. **Please find advice videos from each panelist below.**
