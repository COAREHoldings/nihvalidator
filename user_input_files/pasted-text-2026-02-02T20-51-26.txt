# MINIMAX ENGINEERING SPECIFICATION

## Independent Grant Audit Engine (Standalone Upload Mode)

### Project: GrantMother / GrantMaster

---

## OBJECTIVE

Build an independent, standalone Grant Audit Engine that allows users to upload completed or partially completed grant applications for structured evaluation.

This module must function independently of Build Mode.

It must NOT generate a grant from scratch.
It must strictly evaluate, validate, score, and suggest improvements.

Supported mechanisms:

* Phase I
* Phase II
* Direct-to-Phase II
* Fast Track
* Phase IIB
* (Optional future expansion: R01)

---

# MODULE ROUTE

`/modules/GrantAudit`

Accessible from dashboard via:

"Upload & Audit Existing Grant"

---

# SYSTEM FLOW

User selects mechanism →
Uploads documents →
System parses →
Maps to required structure →
Runs validation engines →
Generates audit report →
Optional AI improvement suggestions →
Export audit report

---

# STEP 1 — DOCUMENT INGESTION

## Supported Formats

* PDF (.pdf)
* Word (.docx)
* Excel (.xlsx) for budgets

## Upload Categories

User may upload individually or as bundle:

* Research Strategy
* Specific Aims
* Budget + Justification
* Commercialization Plan (if applicable)
* Biosketches
* Letters of Support
* Milestones

System must allow partial uploads.

---

# STEP 2 — STRUCTURAL PARSING ENGINE

Create:

`/lib/documentParser.ts`

Responsibilities:

1. Extract headings and subheadings

2. Detect NIH-standard sections

3. Identify:

   * Significance
   * Innovation
   * Approach
   * Statistical plan
   * Milestones
   * Commercialization headings (if Phase II/IIB)

4. Convert to structured JSON

Example structure:

{
phase: "Phase II",
sections: {
aims: {...},
research_strategy: {...},
budget: {...},
commercialization: {...}
}
}

If section cannot be detected:

* Flag as "Unmapped Content"
* Allow manual reassignment by user

---

# STEP 3 — PHASE REQUIREMENT MATRIX

Create:

`/lib/phaseRequirementMatrix.ts`

Matrix defines required components per phase:

Phase I:

* Specific Aims
* Research Strategy (Significance + Approach focus)
* Budget
* Milestones
* Commercialization discussion (brief)

Phase II / Direct-to-Phase II:

* Full Research Strategy
* 12-page Commercialization Plan
* Budget
* Milestones

Fast Track:

* Phase I + Phase II integrated logic
* Transition criteria
* Commercialization Plan

Phase IIB:

* Expanded Commercialization Plan
* Investor/partner evidence
* Advanced regulatory strategy

Engine must flag missing required components.

---

# STEP 4 — VALIDATION ENGINES

Create unified validation core:

`/lib/validationCore.ts`

This core must perform:

## 1. Structural Completeness Audit

* Required sections present?
* Correct headings used?
* Missing attachments?

## 2. Logical Consistency Audit

* Hypothesis ↔ Aims alignment
* Aims ↔ Experiments alignment
* Milestones ↔ Budget alignment
* Market ↔ Revenue alignment

## 3. Budget Compliance Audit

* Cap violations
* Effort inconsistencies
* Subcontract rule violations

## 4. Commercialization Validation (if required)

* All NIH headings present
* Market logic coherent
* Finance and revenue aligned

---

# STEP 5 — SCORING SYSTEM

Create:

`/lib/auditScoringEngine.ts`

Return the following scores (0–100):

1. Structural Completeness Score
2. Scientific Rigor Score
3. Budget Compliance Score
4. Commercialization Strength Score (if applicable)
5. Cross-Module Consistency Score

---

## UNIFIED AUDIT SCORE

Weighted composite:

* Structural completeness (25%)
* Scientific rigor (30%)
* Budget compliance (15%)
* Commercialization strength (20%)
* Cross-module consistency (10%)

Return:

* Final Audit Score (0–100)
* Plain-English explanation of deductions

No funding probability predictions allowed.

---

# STEP 6 — REVIEWER SIMULATION

Create:

`/lib/reviewerSimulation.ts`

Simulate:

1. Scientific Reviewer
2. Commercialization Reviewer (if applicable)
3. Budget Reviewer

Each returns:

* Top 3 weaknesses
* Primary risk category
* Suggested improvement priority

---

# STEP 7 — AI IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTION MODE

After audit, user may enable:

"Generate Improvement Suggestions"

AI must:

* Suggest section-level improvements
* Highlight unclear logic
* Recommend statistical clarification
* Suggest tightening commercialization narrative

Must NOT automatically rewrite full document.
Must allow user-controlled regeneration.

---

# OUTPUT REPORT

Generate downloadable Audit Report including:

* Section-by-section evaluation
* Scores
* Risk heatmap
* Reviewer simulation summaries
* Missing elements checklist

Label clearly:
"Advisory Pre-Submission Audit — Not an NIH Official Review"

---

# NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES

* No fabricated citations
* No false compliance claims
* All scoring explainable
* No automatic content overwriting
* Maintain data security and document privacy

---

# STRATEGIC OUTCOME

Independent Audit Engine functions as a digital pre-study-section evaluation tool for applicants who already possess a completed or near-complete grant.

It remains distinct from Build Mode but shares the same Validation Core architecture.

---

# DOCUMENT REQUIREMENT ALERT SYSTEM

The Independent Grant Audit Engine must include a mandatory Document Requirement Matrix that alerts researchers to missing or required documents based on selected mechanism.

Create:

`/lib/documentRequirementMatrix.ts`

---

## PHASE-BASED REQUIRED DOCUMENT MATRIX

The system must define required and conditional documents per mechanism.

### Phase I

Required:

* Specific Aims
* Research Strategy
* Budget
* Budget Justification
* Milestones
* Biosketches
* Facilities & Other Resources

Commercialization Plan:

* Not required (only brief commercialization discussion inside Research Plan)

---

### Phase II / Direct-to-Phase II

Required:

* Specific Aims
* Full Research Strategy
* Budget + Justification
* Milestones
* 12-page Commercialization Plan
* Biosketches
* Facilities & Other Resources
* Letters of Support (if referenced)

---

### Fast Track

Required:

* Phase I and Phase II research components
* Transition criteria
* 12-page Commercialization Plan
* Budget covering both phases
* Milestones (Phase I and Phase II)

---

### Phase IIB

Required:

* Expanded Commercialization Plan
* Investor/Third-Party Funding Documentation
* Partner Commitment Letters
* Advanced Regulatory Strategy Description
* Budget + Justification
* Milestones

---

## CONDITIONAL DOCUMENT DETECTION

The system must perform NLP-based conditional checks.

Examples:

* If Research Strategy references human subjects → Require Human Subjects section.
* If animal models referenced → Require Vertebrate Animals section.
* If genomic sequencing mentioned → Recommend Data Management Plan.
* If subcontract described → Require Subaward documentation.

If conditional requirement detected but document missing:
→ Display Red Alert.

---

## DOCUMENT STATUS PANEL (UI REQUIREMENT)

Display real-time status table:

| Document                  | Status                     |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Research Strategy         | Present / Missing          |
| Commercialization Plan    | Present / Required Missing |
| Investor Commitment (IIB) | Required Missing           |
| Letters of Support        | Recommended Missing        |

Color coding:

* Green: Present
* Red: Required Missing
* Yellow: Recommended Missing

---

## AUDIT REPORT INTEGRATION

Final Audit Report must include:

* Complete checklist of required documents
* Missing required documents section
* Missing conditional documents section
* Recommended supporting documents section

System must clearly state:
"Administrative incompleteness may result in application rejection."

---

## NON-NEGOTIABLE REQUIREMENTS

* Document matrix must be easily updatable for new NIH Forms versions
* No phase may bypass document validation
* Export must be blocked if required documents are missing (unless user overrides with explicit confirmation)
