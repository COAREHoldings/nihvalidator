# MINIMAX ENGINEERING SPECIFICATION

## Commercialization Director (NIH SBIR/STTR – Phase II, Direct Phase II, Fast Track, Phase IIB)

---

## OBJECTIVE

Implement an NIH-aligned Commercialization Plan builder that activates ONLY for:

* Phase II
* Direct-to-Phase II
* Fast Track (Phase I/II combined)
* Phase IIB

The system must NOT require a 12-page commercialization plan for Phase I.

For Phase I:

* Provide a lightweight "Commercialization Discussion" section embedded in Research Strategy.

---

# ACTIVATION LOGIC

If user selects:

* Phase II
* Direct Phase II
* Fast Track
* Phase IIB

→ Enable Commercialization Director module.

If user selects Phase I only:
→ Disable 12-page Commercialization Plan module.
→ Enable short commercialization discussion prompts inside Research Plan.

---

# NIH REQUIRED HEADINGS (MUST BE PRESERVED VERBATIM)

The compiled document must include EXACTLY these headings in this order:

1. Value of the SBIR/STTR Project, Expected Outcomes, and Impact
2. Company
3. Market, Customer, and Competition
4. Intellectual Property Protection
5. Finance Plan
6. Revenue Stream

System must prevent renaming of headings.

---

# MODULE DESIGN (QUESTION-DRIVEN + AI-ASSISTED)

Each module must:

* Prompt structured questions
* Capture structured responses
* Use AI to refine and format narrative
* Maintain NIH tone (non-promotional)
* Track page usage dynamically
* Allow user editing and approval

---

## MODULE 1

### Value of the SBIR/STTR Project, Expected Outcomes, and Impact

Prompt user:

* What product/service will result?
* What unmet need does it address?
* What outcomes will Phase II achieve?
* What measurable impact is expected?

AI must:

* Convert structured responses into clear narrative
* Remove hype language
* Emphasize measurable outcomes
* Flag unsupported impact claims

Recommended allocation: 1.5–2 pages

---

## MODULE 2

### Company

Prompt user:

* Legal entity status
* Management team
* Technical expertise
* Prior funding
* Commercialization experience

AI must:

* Highlight execution credibility
* Avoid exaggeration
* Align team to commercialization goals

Recommended allocation: 1–1.5 pages

---

## MODULE 3

### Market, Customer, and Competition

Prompt user:

* Who is the paying customer?
* Who is the end user?
* What alternatives exist?
* Why will customers switch?
* Estimated market size assumptions?

AI must:

* Structure TAM/SAM/SOM clearly
* Display assumptions explicitly
* Avoid inflated market claims
* Generate competitive differentiation matrix

Recommended allocation: 2–3 pages

---

## MODULE 4

### Intellectual Property Protection

Prompt user:

* Patents filed or issued?
* Licensing agreements?
* Freedom-to-operate review?
* Exclusivity timeline?

AI must:

* Draft structured IP strategy narrative
* Flag missing protection gaps
* Avoid unsupported claims of "strong IP"

Recommended allocation: 1 page

---

## MODULE 5

### Finance Plan

Prompt user:

* Total capital required post-award?
* Current funding secured?
* Investor commitments?
* Matching funds (for Phase IIB)?
* Burn rate and runway?

AI must:

* Align financing needs with milestones
* Detect unrealistic funding assumptions
* Emphasize investor validation for Phase IIB

Recommended allocation: 2–3 pages

---

## MODULE 6

### Revenue Stream

Prompt user:

* Revenue model (licensing, sales, acquisition)?
* Pricing assumptions?
* Time to revenue?
* Break-even projection?

AI must:

* Display revenue formulas
* Avoid exaggerated projections
* Ensure consistency with market size and finance plan

Recommended allocation: 2 pages

---

# PAGE LIMIT ENFORCEMENT ENGINE

Create:

`/lib/commercializationPageEngine.ts`

Requirements:

* Enforce maximum 12-page limit
* Approximate 500–600 words per page
* Live page counter display
* Show section-by-section allocation

If limit exceeded:

* Display warning
* Offer AI-assisted compression tool
* No silent trimming allowed

---

# PHASE-SPECIFIC DEPTH LOGIC

Phase II:

* Standard commercialization depth required

Fast Track:

* Must integrate Phase I outcomes into commercialization narrative

Phase IIB:

* Require expanded investor validation fields
* Require documentation of third-party funding commitments
* Require advanced regulatory readiness narrative

System must dynamically increase validation strictness for Phase IIB.

---

# AI BEHAVIOR RULES

AI must:

* Not fabricate market statistics
* Flag missing data
* Avoid marketing fluff
* Use structured outputs
* Allow full user edits
* Provide confidence indicators

---

# VALIDATION ENGINE

System must check:

* All six NIH headings present
* Page limit compliance
* Logical alignment between:

  * Market and revenue
  * Finance and milestones
  * IP and competitive claims

Return:

* Commercialization Strength Score (0–100)
* Risk Flags
* Section Weakness Summary

---

# OUTPUT

Export as:

* NIH-formatted Word document
* PDF version

Preserve NIH headings verbatim.

---

# STRATEGIC OUTCOME

Commercialization Director becomes a structured, NIH-compliant, AI-assisted engine that:

* Activates only when required by mechanism
* Enforces the 12-page limit
* Preserves NIH-required headings
* Supports Phase II and Phase IIB maturity expectations

---

# UNIVERSAL COMPILATION & FINAL AUDIT ENGINE

All compilation actions — regardless of phase (Phase I, Phase II, Fast Track, Phase IIB) — must automatically trigger a Universal Audit Layer before export.

This applies to:

* Research Strategy
* Budget
* Commercialization Plan (if applicable)
* Milestones
* Attachments

---

## AUTOMATED POST-COMPILATION REVIEW SEQUENCE

When user clicks "Compile Final Application":

System must automatically run:

1. Structural Completeness Audit

   * Verify all required sections for selected phase are present
   * Identify missing required attachments
   * Flag improperly labeled headings

2. Cross-Module Consistency Check

   * Research Aims ↔ Budget alignment
   * Budget ↔ Milestones alignment
   * Commercialization ↔ Revenue logic alignment
   * IP claims ↔ Competitive claims alignment

3. Phase-Specific Compliance Validation

   * Phase I: Feasibility focus verified
   * Phase II: Commercialization plan present and complete
   * Fast Track: Phase transition logic validated
   * Phase IIB: Investor evidence and advanced regulatory planning verified

4. AI Reviewer Simulation

   * Scientific Reviewer critique
   * Commercialization Reviewer critique (if applicable)
   * Budget Reviewer critique

Each reviewer returns:

* Top 3 weaknesses
* Major risk category
* Suggested improvements

5. Missing Elements Summary

   * Clear checklist of what is included
   * Clear checklist of what is missing
   * Risk-level classification (Low / Moderate / High)

---

## FINAL AI REVIEW & SUGGESTION MODE

After automated checks, AI must generate:

* Executive Summary of strengths
* Executive Summary of weaknesses
* Prioritized improvement suggestions
* Optional section-level rewrite recommendations

All suggestions must:

* Be editable
* Not overwrite existing content automatically
* Clearly label AI-generated recommendations

---

## SUBMISSION READINESS SCORE

Generate unified score (0–100) based on:

* Structural completeness (25%)
* Scientific rigor (25%)
* Budget compliance (20%)
* Commercialization strength (20%)
* Cross-module consistency (10%)

Return plain-English explanation of deductions.

No funding probability percentages allowed.

---

## EXPORT GATE CONTROL

Before final export:

System must display:

☐ All required sections present
☐ Compliance checks complete
☐ AI review completed
☐ I have reviewed flagged weaknesses

User must confirm before final document generation.

---

# STRATEGIC OUTCOME

Every compilation action becomes a structured pre-submission audit event, ensuring that no grant — regardless of phase — is exported without a full structural, financial, commercialization, and AI-driven reviewer evaluation.
