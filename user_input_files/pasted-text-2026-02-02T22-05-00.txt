# NIH RESEARCH STRATEGY VALIDATOR + GENERATOR ENGINE

## Multi-Mechanism Compliance and One-Click Generation Specification

---

# PURPOSE

This document defines the integrated VALIDATOR + GENERATION logic for NIH SBIR/STTR Research Strategy documents.

This system must:

1. Allow users who completed the 8 modules to generate a complete NIH-compliant Research Strategy document at the press of a button.
2. Immediately validate that generated document for structural and mechanism compliance.
3. Flag deficiencies if present.
4. Never auto-modify user content without approval.

The validator is compliance-focused (structure, scope, milestones, regulatory alignment), not stylistic and not impact-scoring.

---

# PRIMARY USER ACTION

After completion of the 8 modules, display:

[ Generate NIH Research Strategy ]

Upon click:

Step 1 – AI Generation Engine builds full document.
Step 2 – Validator immediately runs compliance checks.
Step 3 – User sees:
• Generated document
• Validation report
• PASS / CONDITIONAL PASS / FAIL

User must approve edits before finalizing.

# GENERATION ENGINE (ONE-CLICK BUILD)

## SYSTEM PROMPT TEMPLATE

"You are an NIH study section reviewer and translational scientist.

Using the structured module data below, generate a complete NIH Research Strategy document appropriate for the selected mechanism.

Strict Requirements:

* Follow NIH structure (Significance, Innovation, Approach).
* Include explicit aims-to-experiment mapping.
* Include measurable quantitative milestones.
* Include statistical rationale.
* Include risk mitigation strategies.
* Align scope with mechanism time and budget.
* Avoid exaggeration.
* Do not fabricate citations.

Output a fully formatted Research Strategy ready for review."

# MECHANISM OPTIONS FOR ONE-CLICK GENERATION

User selects mechanism prior to generation:

○ Phase I Only
○ Phase II Only
○ Direct-to-Phase II
○ Fast-Track (Phase I + Phase II)
○ Phase IIB Bridge

The generator must adapt structure automatically.

---

# MECHANISM-SPECIFIC GENERATION RULES

## PHASE I

Generated document must include:

* Significance (Feasibility framing)
* Innovation
* Approach (Technical feasibility focus)
* Risk & Alternative Strategies
* Statistical Plan
* Quantitative Go/No-Go Criteria

Must clearly answer:
"What feasibility must be demonstrated to justify Phase II?"

---

## PHASE II

Generated document must include:

* Significance (Translational framing)
* Innovation (Product differentiation)
* Summary of Phase I accomplishments (if provided)
* Expanded Development Plan
* Statistical Plan
* Regulatory Alignment
* Commercialization Integration
* Quantitative Milestones

---

## DIRECT-TO-PHASE II

Must include:

* Strong Preliminary Data Summary
* Justification for bypassing Phase I
* Development Plan
* Statistical Plan
* Regulatory and Commercial Alignment
* Milestones

System must warn if module data lacks sufficient feasibility depth.

---

## FAST-TRACK

Must generate:

1. Fast-Track Overview (Bridge section)
2. Phase I Research Strategy
3. Phase I Milestones + Go/No-Go Criteria
4. Phase II Research Strategy
5. Phase II Milestones
6. Integrated Milestone Table

Must include explicit phase transition gates.

---

## PHASE IIB

Must include:

* Summary of prior SBIR results
* Regulatory advancement plan
* Manufacturing scale plan
* Commercialization & capital strategy
* Quantitative commercialization milestones

---

# VALIDATOR ENGINE (AUTOMATIC POST-GENERATION CHECK)

Immediately after generation, validator checks:

GLOBAL CHECKS:

1. Required NIH sections present.
2. Logical flow: Problem → Hypothesis → Aims → Experiments → Milestones.
3. Quantitative milestones defined.
4. Statistical plan included.
5. Risk mitigation included.
6. Scope consistent with mechanism.
7. No obvious duplication between sections.

MECHANISM-SPECIFIC CHECKS:

Phase I:

* Feasibility objective present
* Go/No-Go criteria defined

Phase II:

* Phase I achievements referenced (if applicable)
* Regulatory trajectory described

Direct-to-Phase II:

* Preliminary data strength evident
* Justification for bypass present

Fast-Track:

* Phase I and II both present
* Explicit transition gate defined
* Integrated milestone table present

Phase IIB:

* Prior SBIR achievements summarized
* Commercialization milestones present

# VALIDATION OUTPUT FORMAT

After generation, display:

VALIDATION SUMMARY

SECTION COMPLETENESS:
✓ Significance
✓ Innovation
✓ Approach

MILESTONES:
✓ Quantitative thresholds present

STATISTICAL PLAN:
✓ Defined tests and rationale

MECHANISM ALIGNMENT:
✓ Scope appropriate for Phase I

FINAL STATUS:
PASS / CONDITIONAL PASS / FAIL

If CONDITIONAL or FAIL, list required corrections.

Validator does NOT rewrite.
Validator only flags.

---

# USER CONTROL

After generation and validation:

User may:

* Edit document manually
* Regenerate specific section
* Accept as Final Draft
* Export NIH-formatted version

No AI revision auto-applies without explicit user action.

---

# END STATE

At the press of one button, a researcher who completed the modules can:

• Generate a full NIH-compliant Research Strategy
• Instantly validate structural compliance
• See deficiencies clearly
• Edit or regenerate sections
• Export submission-ready draft

This system integrates generation and compliance enforcement while preserving u
